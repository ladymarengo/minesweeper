# Minesweeper

My first project in C++ - implementation of the classic game.

The main goal for this project was to try the SDL development library but also I wanted to get familiar with C++. I learned a lot about OOP and now I realize that the project is in need of refactoring but I decided to leave it as it is because it's still nice enough.

All assets are made by myself.

If you want to try it:
- You'll need Linux with installed SDL and SDL_image libraries
- Clone the repo and run "make run". It will compile the executable and run it.

Also you can try to compile it on other systems but it may need some changes in the Makefile and the header.
